# My ZSH config
## Installation

To set up the Zsh configuration and the Powerlevel10k theme directly from the repository, you can use the following one-liner:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdellahi-brahim/zsh/main/setup.sh | bash
```

After running the script, ensure that the Powerlevel10k theme is set as your default Zsh theme by checking your `.zshrc` file.
